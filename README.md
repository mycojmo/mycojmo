# hi! is this thing on??

### Desirable (have done it, can do it; i absolutely love it.)
#### 1. Throw me in the deep end
- Fearless pursuer of order amidst chaos
- Make sense of complicated, tangled web of complexity
- Ask questions to uncover root issue(s)
- New toolchain, new framework, new cloud, new editor; all good with me!
#### 2. Growing your talent (internally and via hiring)
- Coaching where needed, advocate for, promote internally **or** *externally*
- Validate ability and drive
- Supercharging output
- Watch as folks discover their inner worth
#### 3.  A client is stuck
- You know the feeling of "The production bug is a result of *my code*." ? i crave working like this supercharged feeling without the prod bug!
- I see the way out of the problem for the client :: It's **go** time -- i'm going to be working **late** on this one.
#### 4.  No one else wants to do the grunt work / manual labor / annoying task
- Put me in coach! Just **get it done**

### Not Desirable (have done it, can do it; i do not like it.)
1. Setting job titles and setting roles and responsibilities for them.
2. Setting budgets or staff asks
3. Designing career tracks and promotional pathways.
4. Setting paybands and justifying promotions across departments
5. Vendor management
